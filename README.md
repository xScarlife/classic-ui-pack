Before you continue reading the installation instructions please note that this is the 'normal' version of my Classic Wotlk interface which does not have ElvUI as the main interface. I also have a version where ElvUI is needed which can be found on the other Github page link, see Discord.

Please note that you'll need to setup the addons how you like it. I cannot share my settings but if you need help, don't hesitate to ask.

This package contains all the addons I use in-game. Please make sure you follow the steps below before you continue making any changes. If you have any problems during installation or you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to ask for help in the Discord server, me and my moderators are happy to help where we can.

If you don't know how to install addons manually, please watch my video where I teach you how to do that by clicking this link: https://youtu.be/huUvI7O-6lE?t=83. Instead of choosing the 'retail' folder you choose the 'classic' folder. Just FYI.

## Installation
Open the .rar file and this will contain all the addons I use. You can simply drag and drop the folder over to your WoW Classic addons folder mostly located on your main C: drive like so, C:\World of Warcraft_classic_\Interface\AddOns.

When your addons are installed, navigate to C:\World of Warcraft\_classic_ (or where your game is installed) and paste in the 'Fonts' folder. This will install the fonts used for the interface.

Extra: If you can't open .rar files, you can download WinRAR here: https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0

Once you dragged and dropped the desired addon folders from the .rar file to your AddOns folder you can simply close all windows and launch your game. When on the character selection screen, please go to the lower left corner and select 'AddOns'. Make sure that all the addons you want to load in-game are checked or this can cause problems if you are missing one.
